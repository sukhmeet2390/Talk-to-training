1. move user box to a javascript class of its own.
2. do not use global methods. Put them under a namaspaced element.
3. make two globals - userList and tweetList. Now you can invoke global methods in those files by doing a userList.fnName
4. move <ul id="userList / tweetList"> to the respective lists.
This means that your Controller.js (formerly List.js) creates instances of TweetList and UserList and then does something to the
effect of
document.getElementById("tweetListContainer").appendChild(tweetList.getDom());

(function() {
	var makeAjaxCall = function(args) {

	}
	sukhmeet = {
		fn: function() {
			makeAjaxCall();
		}
	}
})();
